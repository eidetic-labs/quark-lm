# Transformer

v0.24 introduced a tiny decoder-only transformer in
`closed_world_lm.transformer_char_model`.

It is intentionally small:

- corpus-trained character tokenizer
- learned token and position embeddings
- one causal self-attention block
- one feed-forward block
- next-character language-model head
- dependency-free scalar autodiff
- random initialization only

Train a smoke checkpoint:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m closed_world_lm.transformer_char_model train \
  --run runs/transformer-smoke \
  --steps 40 \
  --context-size 8 \
  --embedding-dim 6 \
  --feedforward-dim 12
```

Evaluate answer probes:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m closed_world_lm.transformer_char_model eval \
  --checkpoint runs/transformer-smoke/transformer.json \
  --json runs/transformer-smoke/transformer_eval.json
```

Train on corpus-derived answer lessons:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m closed_world_lm.transformer_char_model answer-train \
  --run runs/transformer-answer-smoke \
  --steps 100 \
  --eval-every 0 \
  --candidate-scope eval \
  --selector-steps 200 \
  --selector-eval-every 0 \
  --selector-emit-completions \
  --generator-steps 400 \
  --generator-eval-every 0 \
  --direct-answer-steps 100 \
  --direct-answer-eval-every 0 \
  --direct-answer-mode periodic-balanced-repair-unlikelihood \
  --direct-answer-negative-weight 1.0 \
  --direct-answer-positive-weight 1.0 \
  --direct-answer-rollout-interval 50
```

Latest bounded stacked-transformer screen:

| Signal | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Run | `runs/transformer-answer-v0.43-two-layer-toponly-skip-screen-dim8-context32/` |
| Layers | `2` |
| Steps | `40` target-loss + `80` direct-answer |
| Direct-answer update scope | top layer and language-model head only |
| Post-direct candidate snapshot | skipped and recorded in metrics |
| Pre-direct candidate accuracy | `15/219 -> 15/219` |
| Pre-direct answer target NLL | `3.5855 -> 3.4796` |
| Direct answer target loss | `3.5186 -> 3.2436` |
| Direct answer exact | `0/219 -> 0/219` |
| Failure pattern | repeated `"a"` greedy completion |
| Promotion status | screening evidence only |

The transformer is not yet promoted as a reliable responder. It is architecture
evidence: a from-scratch attention model can update weights on the admitted
corpus and leave a checkpoint plus metrics. v0.42 preserves the `37/219`
transformer-only candidate result while improving answer-target NLL versus
v0.41, but raw greedy completion still fails exact answers with the short wrong
completion `" te."`. The latest v0.43 stacked screen proves that two-layer
top-layer-only direct-answer training can complete and write a checkpoint when
the expensive post-direct candidate snapshot is explicitly skipped, but its
repeated `"a"` output is still a failed direct decoder. v0.31's no-candidate
transformer-guided generator remains useful comparison evidence, but it is not
raw transformer decoding.
